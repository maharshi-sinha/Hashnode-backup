## Introduction

Hola Amigos! Hope you'll are doing amazing. This is the 2nd blog in the series "Learn Flutter". In this series, I'm documenting all of my learning of Flutter through my blogs. In this blog, I'm covering <mark>"Dart Language"</mark> like what is Dart, the history of Dart language, some learning resources and all but from the next, I'll cover all the basics use cases about Dart with code till then enjoy this blog.

As we all know in the world of programming, various languages play crucial roles. One such language that's gaining momentum in mobile development is Dart. Developed by Google, Dart is a versatile and powerful language that serves various purposes. As I already mentioned, in this blog, we're going to understand what Dart is, its origins, its features, and why it's gaining popularity among developers.

## History of Dart

Dart was officially announced by Google in 2011. It was created as a language that could address some of the "shortcomings" of JavaScript, which is/was the dominant language for web development. Dart aimed to offer better performance, developer-friendly tooling, and a more structured approach to building web applications.

Although Dart didn't initially replace JavaScript as the primary web programming language, it found its niche in other domains, particularly mobile app development with Flutter.

## Dart With Flutter

## Key Features of Dart

1. Object-Oriented
    

Dart is an object-oriented language, meaning it uses classes and objects for structuring code. This makes it easy to create and manage complex systems.

1. Strongly Typed
    

Dart is a statically typed language, which means you must declare the data type of a variable before using it. This feature catches potential errors at compile time, enhancing code reliability.

1. Just-In-Time (JIT) and Ahead-Of-Time (AOT) Compilation
    

Dart supports both JIT and AOT compilation. JIT allows for fast development and hot reloading, while AOT produces highly optimized, standalone executables. This versatility makes Dart suitable for various use cases.

1. Modern Language Features
    

Dart includes modern language features such as async/await for handling asynchronous operations, a powerful type system, and a concise syntax that enhances developer productivity.

1. Large Standard Library
    

Dart has a rich standard library that provides a wide range of built-in functions and classes, reducing the need for third-party libraries.

1. Community Support
    

Dart has amazing community support and lots of folks are actively contributing to Dart-lang on a daily basis, you can also check out the repo and start contributing to it:

## Code Structure

```dart
void main ()
{
\\code
\\code
}
```

Isn't this code structure looking familiar with some other language....yes! you correctly guessed Dart looks like 'kinda' a mixture of Java & JavaScript. So, if you're already familiar with these languages then Dart might look easier to you and you can easily grab the concepts quickly.

## Dart and Flutter

One of the main reasons for Dart's growth in popularity is its association with Flutter, Google's open-source UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications. Flutter uses Dart as its primary language, enabling developers to create cross-platform mobile apps with a single codebase.

Flutter and Dart have a symbiotic relationship. Dart's performance, robustness, and hot reload feature align perfectly with Flutter's goals, making it a preferred choice for mobile app development. The combination of Dart and Flutter has resulted in the creation of visually stunning and high-performing mobile applications.
