## Cool VS Code Extension to increase your productivity

The word **editor** and IDE (integrated development environments) are often mistakenly used interchangeably. However, there are some big differences between the two. The extra functionality you get with an IDE can provide significant time savings, reduce context switching and make coding much easier for you.

Here are just five (the list is long) important differences why editor users should consider an IDE:

- Debugging

- Unit Testing

- Code Refactoring & Profiling

- Source Code Integration

- Development and Release Tool Integration

> Ok, now let's talk about **Code Editor** too.

# What is CODE EDITOR....?

A **source-code** editor is a text editor program designed specifically for * **editing source code of computer programs** *. It may be a standalone application or it may be built into an *integrated development environment (IDE)* or web browser. Source-code editors are a fundamental programming tool, as the fundamental job of programmers is to write and edit source code.

So basically, this are the introduction about **IDE** as well as ** *Code Editor* ** and in this blog I'm going to talk about ** *VS Code* **. Now let's take a glace about it :

# What is Visual Studio Codes ?


Visual Studio Code is a streamlined code editor with support for development operations like debugging, task running, and version control. It aims to provide just the tools a developer needs for a quick code-build-debug cycle and leaves more complex workflows to fuller featured IDEs, such as Visual Studio IDE.

# Why Visual Studio Codes ?

Visual Studio Code is a lightweight but powerful source code editor which runs on your desktop and is available for Windows , macOS and Linux. It comes with built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript and Node.js and has a rich ecosystem of extensions for other languages (such as C++, C#, Java, Python, PHP, Go) and runtimes (such as .NET and Unity).

# -  Microsoft Live Share

> Live share actually allows you to collaborate with ** *voice code* ** on a shared project through a client and a host live. So you can actually see the **code editing** in real time where the little cursor, if you want, you've got some chat in there at different types of missions.
